# We Care People
## 1.Idea:
- Category: Social
- Mobile: Underprivileged people might not have a mobile; even they might possess a mobile but
not familiar with using apps. However, somebody witnessing anybody without food on the street
or anybody who knows that their neighbors or people living on the street or homeless people
need food can post it in the app based on the location people can help.
- Story: When somebody posts a need in the app, the users' available option would be shown
based on the vicinity of his/her area.
- Market: The young generation can contribute to a great extent. For example, if somebody has
extra food, she/he wants to share but cannot commute to a place where the food is needed.
Anyone in the app voluntarily agrees to transport the goods.
- Scope: Everybody who is involved in this donation circle can influence others to do the same
and somehow get recognized through the app.
-User cases:
+ First people will sign in or sign up
+ In the main board, they can see
* Posts about what available and compost post, and comment in posts
* Info about user, and sign out
+ When they sign out, they come back to main sign in

## 2. User stories:

eat.
As a restaurant owener, I have plenty of leftover with good quality and I want to bring them to
